## Reporting a Vulnerability 

This repository and community take all security vulnerabilities
seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our open source 
software. Even when unsure whether the bug in question is an exploitable
vulnerability, it is recommended to send a report. We appreciate your
efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the Community security team at:
    
- security@codecrpyt76.com

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 24 hours, and will
send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in 
handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security
team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and
full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or 
team maintaining the module.

üö®**Note**:  _Please do not open public issues for security issues, as GitHub does not provide
facility for private issues, and deleting the issue makes it hard to triage/respond back to the reporter._


## Disclosure Policy

The master_python_template team is a volunteer-only effort, and may reach back out for
clarification. When the security team receives a security bug report, they
will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix
and release process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes
    will be released as fast as possible to NPM.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/seraph776/https://github.com/seraph776/sql-injection-hacker-challenege/pulls) or file an [issue](https://github.com/seraph776/sql-injection-hacker-challenege/issues/new/) to discuss.
