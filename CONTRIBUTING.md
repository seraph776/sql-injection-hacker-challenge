# Welcome to the Contributing Guide docs

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en) :sparkles:. 
Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/seraph776/sql-injection-hacker-challenge/blob/main/docs/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable. In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.


##  New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](https://github.com/seraph776/sql-injection-hacker-challenge). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started 

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the docs repository](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/working-in-docs-repository.md) :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Check to see what [types of contributions](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes.
Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.


## Issues

If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.


## Bug reporting 

We encourage people to report bugs. Please read [How to Submit a Good Bug Report](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/blob/main/bug_report.adoc) before submitting your report. The most important advice from there is: 1) do as thorough a search as you can to see whether the bug has already been reported, and 2) be as precise and complete as you can when reporting a new bug.
To report a bug:

1. Go to the appropriate project.
2. Click the Issues button on the left of the window.
3. Click the "New issue" button.
4. Fill out the Title and Description. You don't need to fill out the other fields. (Shall we encourage readers to use the Label field?)
